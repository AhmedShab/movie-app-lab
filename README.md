# React movie app lab

## Objectives:
  - Practice building an app using external API
  
## React Router App:
In this lab, you would need to build the following pages:

  - Home
  - Movie
  
## Components
  Our `src` folder contains the following:
   ```
   src/
      ├── App.js
      ├── Home.js
      ├── Movie.js
      └── Index.js
   ```
   
## Tasks
 Your task is to use [omdb api](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for a movie.
 
 Your app should look like something similar to this:
   - [Home Page](https://github.com/ahmedSDev/movie-app-lab/blob/master/home_page.PNG)
   - [Movie Page](https://github.com/ahmedSDev/movie-app-lab/blob/master/movie_page.PNG)
   - [Movie search result](https://github.com/ahmedSDev/movie-app-lab/blob/master/movie_page_search.PNG)
